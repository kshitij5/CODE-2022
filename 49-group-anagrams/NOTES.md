Hints :
1. what is anagram exactly? can we do something to all the anagrams of a word to return to its initial string?
2. can a anagram of word is also the anagram of its sorted string?
3. can we solve the problem using map somehow?

Extra tip: Counting sort can also be used to decrease the time complexity!
